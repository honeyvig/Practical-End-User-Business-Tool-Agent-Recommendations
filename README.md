# Practical-End-User-Business-Tool-Agent-Recommendations
Looking for a tool AI guru to provide practical end user Business tool/agents recommendations

Goal: give me a list of tools/agents/functions that are useful for a general business user or executive.

For example:
mindy.com- Attach to calendar and gives daily emails of schedule and latest information on each of those contents.
Setup- mindy.com....

I dont want:
1) all the ways you can use chatGPT or a similar GenAI to rewrite marketing pitches etc. I'm looking for practicle tools for productivity. Nothing to do with blog/social media posting.
2) an AI generated list of tools. I'm looking for quality not quantity. You should have tried the tool out

.
============
To create a Python-based solution for providing practical AI tools for business users, focusing on productivity tools rather than marketing or social media management, we can develop a simple tool recommendation system. This system will focus on tools that executives and general business users would find useful, such as calendar management, task management, and workflow optimization. Below is an example Python implementation for such a tool, leveraging APIs and integrating AI to provide smart recommendations.
1. Tool/Agent Recommendation System (Python)

We will build a basic tool recommendation system that provides practical AI-driven business tools for productivity. The tool list will be pre-configured, focusing on specific categories such as task management, scheduling, communication, and data analysis.

Libraries youâ€™ll need:

pip install requests pandas

Step 1: Define the list of useful business tools

Below is a list of practical business tools categorized into types like Calendar Management, Task Management, and Project Management.
Step 2: Implement the Recommendation System

import pandas as pd

# List of recommended tools with their description, category, and setup URL
tools = [
    {"name": "Mindy", "category": "Calendar Management", "description": "Attaches to your calendar and sends daily emails of your schedule and related information.", "setup_url": "https://mindy.com"},
    {"name": "Trello", "category": "Task Management", "description": "A collaboration tool that organizes your projects and tasks into boards.", "setup_url": "https://trello.com"},
    {"name": "Slack", "category": "Communication", "description": "A communication platform for teams to collaborate, share files, and streamline messaging.", "setup_url": "https://slack.com"},
    {"name": "Asana", "category": "Project Management", "description": "Helps teams orchestrate work, from daily tasks to strategic initiatives.", "setup_url": "https://asana.com"},
    {"name": "Zapier", "category": "Automation", "description": "Automates repetitive tasks by connecting your favorite apps and tools.", "setup_url": "https://zapier.com"},
    {"name": "Notion", "category": "Documentation & Knowledge Management", "description": "An all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate, and get organized.", "setup_url": "https://notion.so"},
    {"name": "Google Workspace", "category": "Collaboration", "description": "A set of cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools including Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Drive.", "setup_url": "https://workspace.google.com"},
    {"name": "Monday.com", "category": "Task Management", "description": "A work operating system to manage any aspect of your work, from tasks to workflows.", "setup_url": "https://monday.com"},
    {"name": "ClickUp", "category": "Task Management", "description": "A productivity platform that allows teams to manage tasks, documents, goals, and more.", "setup_url": "https://clickup.com"},
    {"name": "HubSpot CRM", "category": "Customer Relationship Management", "description": "A CRM tool that helps businesses grow by organizing, automating, and analyzing interactions with customers.", "setup_url": "https://hubspot.com"}
]

# Convert the list to a DataFrame for better management and filtering
df_tools = pd.DataFrame(tools)

# Function to recommend tools based on category
def recommend_tools(category=None):
    if category:
        recommended_tools = df_tools[df_tools['category'].str.contains(category, case=False)]
    else:
        recommended_tools = df_tools  # Return all tools if no category is specified
    return recommended_tools[['name', 'category', 'description', 'setup_url']]

# Example: Get tools for Task Management
def get_task_management_tools():
    return recommend_tools("Task Management")

# Example: Get all tools
def get_all_tools():
    return recommend_tools()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Display all tools
    print("All Tools:\n", get_all_tools())

    # Display tools for Task Management
    print("\nTask Management Tools:\n", get_task_management_tools())

Step 3: How this works

    Tools List: The list contains various AI-powered tools (e.g., Mindy, Trello, Zapier) that cater to different business needs. These tools are categorized into specific categories such as Task Management, Calendar Management, Automation, etc.

    Pandas DataFrame: We use a Pandas DataFrame to store and filter the tools. This makes it easy to search and retrieve tools based on the category or business requirement.

    Recommendations: Based on the category or user needs, the system can suggest appropriate tools. For example, if you need Task Management tools, you can use the get_task_management_tools() function to retrieve tools like Trello or Asana.

Step 4: Example Output

When you run the script, you'll see outputs similar to this:
All Tools:

                name                  category                                     description                            setup_url

Step 5: Expand/Customize the List

You can extend this list by adding more tools specific to different industries or business functions. Additionally, as new AI-powered tools become available, you can integrate them into the recommendation system for continuous improvement.
Conclusion:

This Python-based tool recommendation system is highly customizable and can easily be expanded with new tools and categories. It offers practical suggestions tailored to business users looking for AI-driven tools to optimize their productivity. The recommendation system can be embedded into any application or used as a stand-alone script for executives to quickly find tools that suit their needs.
